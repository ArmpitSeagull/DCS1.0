            <h2>What is securing the configuration? </h2> <p>Securing the configuration refers to some security measures that are implemented when building and installing computers and network devices to reduce unnecessary cyber vulnerabilities.<br> These measures are the best way to start off using your new computer whether it be a home computer and network or one you are using in your business.<br> <br> These can very easily be overlooked to home users when they get a fancy new computer and are not educated with the hardware and devices used to set up the home network so we will add an easy-to-follow checklist with-in this page to help you keep track of what steps to take and feel more confident with your computer and network. </p>
          
          
        </div>
        <div class="services__card">
          
          <h3>Why is securing the configuration important.</h3>
          
          <p>Manufacturers often set the default configurations of new software and hardware to be as streamlined and multifunctional as possible for their business. In the case of a router for example, this will have a predefined password and usually “ADMIN” for the username. This is not ideal and we will give you recommendations on what to do when you get a new piece of hardware. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Laptop’s and PC’s will come with default accounts and some pre installed apps and opened ports that are also vulnerabilities to a new computer/network set-up that need to be addressed. 
<br><br>
There’s also default firewall rules and web server configuration that can lead to a breach of your network that will be address through this website.  </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="services__card">
          
          <h3>How to protect yourself</h3> <p>We will give you a baseline checklist to go through to help insure your data security and cyber resilience as well as an understanding of what these step will do to help prevent a breach of your system.  </p>
          <h3>Default accounts and passwords:</h3>
          
          
          <p>when you get a new pc or router, they come with a default configuration. For your pc, create a new account with a solid password and delete all default accounts or un-used accounts including there passwords. For router, it’s a similar process but changing the username and/or password to make sure its secure.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>Removing pre-installed software that is not necessary to the function of the system helps to eliminate possible avenues into your system. Keeping all used software up-to-date and safe. </p>
          <p>Disable the Auto-Run feature on your PC to prevent files from automatically installing them selves or other applications to your system with your permission. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="services">
      <div class="services__container">
        <div class="services__card">
          
            <p>Change your password at least every six months. This is a good practice because if you use a password for more than one thing then there might be a chance that a data breach may have occurred without your knowing on another site and your password may be loose.</p>
          <p>Set up your firewall to allow data from only trusted webservers and applications. </p>
          <p>Patch management is also a good rule to practice. Keeping a record of when you updated your system and its firmware will help you to determine if there was a breach, when it happened and on what version of the system and firmware. </p>
          <p>Malware and anti-virus protection is also a vital part of keeping your system safe and free of attacking programs. </p>
          <p>Then there are access controls. Making sure only authorised persons have access to the administrative accounts that control all system functions including updates, password changes, firewall rules and account modifications.  </p>

          <h3>Check list for securing your configuration.</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Software Installation and Management</li>
            <li>Passwords and accounts </li>
            <li>Privileges and people </li>
            <li>Disable Auto-Run  </li>
            <li>Check Firewall Rules </li>
            <li>Documentation and File Management</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1. Software Instillation and management.</h3>
          
          <p>Have a routine for installing new software on your systems, so that’s limiting access to the network if needed. Allowing it through the firewall or not basically. Saving it to the desired file location with permissions for particular people, so if it’s compromised the virus has less room to infect the system or a hacker can’t gain access to the main storage device usually the c: drive. The management of new software installations should be supported by documenting procedures keeping everything streamlined and correct. </p>
          
        </div>
        
        <div class="services__card">
          
          <h3>2. Password and Accounts.</h3> <p>You want to avoid using default passwords at all costs. Try make passwords that have no connection with your job or life. Old router passwords are good ones, they are strong and not in use anymore.  Passwords for your devices, folders, system access, router access and your USB’s all should be monitored and changed every 6 months or less.   </p>
          <p>As well as accounts. You want to disable all accounts or delete them and only have accounts that are needed or used for the running of your business. Each person using a system should have their own account with their own passwords. This will let you narrow down any unusual traffic on the network and who was using the system at any given time. This will help with the investigation of a data breach or infection  if there is one. </p>
        </div>
          <div class="services">
      <div class="services__container">
        <div class="services__card1">
          
            <img id="main__img2" src="images/picture11.png" />
       
        </div>
        <div class="services__card">
          
          <h3>3. Privileges and people.</h3>
          
          <p>You will want to assign certain privileges and directory permissions to everyone who will be using a system. Block all other accounts from having access to the firewall setting and computer settings so that only the administrative account can change settings and allow applications through the firewall and network.</p>

          <h3>4. Disable auto-run.</h3>
          
          <p> features on windows. Doing this will help prevent the instillation of malware and viruses so a program can’t automatically install other software on the system without first asking for permission from an administrator. Doing this will alert you to possible virus installations.</p>
          <h3>5. Firewalls and their rules. </h3>
          <P>We will have a firewall on the router to stop unwanted traffic getting into the network completely, then we will have firewalls on all PC’s with the main computer having the capability to change any setting on the network. This would be added security for your data. We could even go as far as putting firewalls on your mobile devices to eliminate those as risks also. </P>
        </div>
        
        <div class="services__card">
          
          <h3>6. Documentation and management.</h3> <p> You can have databases on one password protected drive password protected folders and limited network access. Separate from the OS drive so that of a drive is compromised the system still works for you to investigate the breach and it will be less likely a hacker can gain control over your system and hold you ransom. Have further storage devices for other data like financial or personal data. Basically, having everything split up into separate drives helps reduce the spread of viruses and hacker moving around the system. <br>

Keeping everything, you do from setting up firewall rules and protocols to software installations documented and document the steps taken to implement these changes will be vital to keeping your system up to date and regulated as well as going back to check for anything that has been changed or missed during software installations, firmware updates and patches. This documentation should be stored on a secure drive or a computer that has no internet facing capabilities.</p>
